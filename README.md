# Road Accidents Analysis
This Project is an Exploratory Analysis which seeks to uncover insights and patterns in the occurence of casualties caused by road accidents. It sheds light on a variety of vehicle types, accident locations as well as the seasonality of these accident occurences.

## Summary of Casualties
### ‚ò£Ô∏è Casualty by Severity
A total of 417,883 casualties was recorded, which was then grouped into three based on their severity as shown below;
- Fatal Severity was the least occurent with a total of 7,135 cases, preceded by
- Serious severity with a total of 59,312 occurences, while
- Slight severity topped the chart with a whooping 351,436 number of cases. 

### üöó Casualty by  Vehicle Types
- Cars, Bikes and Vans had the higher number of casualties than other vehicles, while
- Buses, Agricultural and other vehicles had lesser amounts.

### üå¶Ô∏è Casualty Classification by Road Surface
- A great proportion of accidents occurred during dry and wet seasons. Ice/Snow conditions possibly keep people indoors and hence, lower amount of casualties was recorded in these times.

### üõ£Ô∏è Casualty Classification by Road Type
- Most accidents occurred on Single carriageways as anticipated. However, Dual carriageways also showed high amount of casualty records as well as Roundabouts.

## Recommendations
- The government must minimize the construction of Single Carriageways except when compulsory (and must have strict guidelines when constructed.) 
- Speed limit laws should be put on car and van drivers, as well as bike riders to reduce accident occurences.
- Traffic rules must be observed more critically during Dry and Wet seasons as more accidents and casualties were noticed in these times.
